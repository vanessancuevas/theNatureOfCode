/**
 * One of the two render modes in p5.js, used for computationally intensive tasks like 3D rendering and shaders.
 * 
 * `WEBGL` differs from the default <a href="/reference/p5/P2D">`P2D`</a> renderer in the following ways:
 * 
 * - Coordinate System - When drawing in `WEBGL` mode, the origin point (0,0,0) is located at the center of the screen, not the top-left corner. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/coordinates-and-transformations/">the tutorial page about coordinates and transformations</a>.
 * 
 * - 3D Shapes - `WEBGL` mode can be used to draw 3-dimensional shapes like <a href="#/p5/box">box()</a>, <a href="#/p5/sphere">sphere()</a>, <a href="#/p5/cone">cone()</a>, and <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#3D%20Primitives">more</a>. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/custom-geometry/">the tutorial page about custom geometry</a> to make more complex objects.
 * 
 * - Shape Detail - When drawing in `WEBGL` mode, you can specify how smooth curves should be drawn by using a `detail` parameter. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#3d-primitives-shapes">the wiki section about shapes</a> for a more information and an example.
 * 
 * - Textures - A texture is like a skin that wraps onto a shape. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#textures">the wiki section about textures</a> for examples of mapping images onto surfaces with textures.
 * 
 * - Materials and Lighting - `WEBGL` offers different types of lights like <a href="#/p5/ambientLight">ambientLight()</a> to place around a scene. Materials like <a href="#/p5/specularMaterial">specularMaterial()</a> reflect the lighting to convey shape and depth. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/lights-camera-materials/">the tutorial page for styling and appearance</a> to experiment with different combinations.
 * 
 * - Camera - The viewport of a `WEBGL` sketch can be adjusted by changing camera attributes. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/lights-camera-materials#camera-and-view">the tutorial page section about cameras</a> for an explanation of camera controls.
 * 
 * - Text - `WEBGL` requires opentype/truetype font files to be preloaded using <a href="#/p5/loadFont">loadFont()</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#text">the wiki section about text</a> for details, along with a workaround.
 * 
 * - Shaders - Shaders are hardware accelerated programs that can be used for a variety of effects and graphics. See the <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/intro-to-shaders/">introduction to shaders</a> to get started with shaders in p5.js.
 * 
 * - Graphics Acceleration - `WEBGL` mode uses the graphics card instead of the CPU, so it may help boost the performance of your sketch (example: drawing more shapes on the screen at once).
 * 
 * To learn more about WEBGL mode, check out <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/#webgl">all the interactive WEBGL tutorials</a> in the "Tutorials" section of this website, or read the wiki article <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5">"Getting started with WebGL in p5"</a>.

   * <a href="#/p5/background">background()</a>, and

   * using the RGB color model. This is equivalent to calling
   * `colorMode(RGB, 255)`. Pure red is `color(255, 0, 0)` in this model.
   * 
   * Calling `colorMode(RGB, 100)` sets colors to use RGB color values
   * between 0 and 100. Pure red is `color(100, 0, 0)` in this model.
   * 
   * Calling `colorMode(HSB)` or `colorMode(HSL)` changes to HSB or HSL systems instead of RGB.
   * Pure red is `color(0, 100, 100)` in HSB and `color(0, 100, 50)` in HSL.
   * 
   * Some additional color modes that p5.js supports are:
   * 
   * `RGBHDR` - High Dynamic Range RGB defined within the Display P3 color space.
   * Colors are expressed with an extended dynamic range. To render these colors
   * accurately, you must use the HDR canvas.
   * 
   * `HWB`    - Hue, Whiteness, Blackness.
   * Similar to HSB and HSL, this mode uses a hue angle.
   * Instead of saturation and lightness, HWB defines colors based on the percentage
   * of whiteness and blackness. This is the color model used by Chrome's GUI color picker.
   * Pure red in HWB is represented as `color(0, 0, 0)` (i.e., hue 0 with 0% whiteness and 0% blackness).
   * 
   * `     <img src="assets/hwb.png"></img>``LAB`    - Also known as CIE Lab, this color mode defines colors with Lightness, Alpha, and Beta.
   * It is widely used in professional color measurement contexts due to its perceptual uniformity.
   * 
   * `LCH`    - A more intuitive representation of the CIE Lab color space using Lightness, Chroma, and Hue.
   * This mode separates the color's chromatic intensity (chroma) from its lightness,
   * simplifying color selection and manipulation.
   * 
   * `OKLAB`  - A variant of the CIE Lab color space that corrects for non-uniformities inherent in LAB.
   * The adjustment provides a more perceptually accurate and uniform representation,
   * which is particularly beneficial for smooth color transitions.
   * 
   * `OKLCH`  - An easier-to-use representation of OKLAB, expressing colors in terms of Lightness, Chroma, and Hue.
   * This mode retains the perceptual benefits of OKLAB while offering a more intuitive format for color manipulation.
   * 
   * <a href="#/p5.Color">p5.Color</a> objects remember the mode that they were
   * created in. Changing modes doesn't affect their appearance.
   * 
   * `Single-value (Grayscale) Colors`:
   * When a color is specified with only one parameter (e.g., `color(g)`), p5.js will interpret it
   * as a grayscale color. However, how that single parameter translates into a grayscale value
   * depends on the color mode:
   * 
   * - `RGB, HSB, and HSL`: In RGB, the single value is interpreted using the “blue” maximum
   * (i.e., the single parameter is mapped to the blue channel's max).
   * In HSB and HSL, the single value is mapped to Brightness and Lightness max respectively with hue=0 .
   * and saturation=0.
   * 
   * - `LAB, LCH, OKLAB, and OKLCH`: The single value is taken to be the `lightness (L)` component,
   * with the specified max range for that channel.
   * 
   * - `HWB`: Grayscale relies on both the `whiteness (W)` and `blackness (B)` channels. Since
   * a single value cannot directly account for two distinct channels, the library uses an
   * average of their max values to interpret the single grayscale parameter. For instance,
   * if W has a max of 50 and B has a max of 100, then the single grayscale parameter
   * is mapped using (50 + 100) / 2 = 75 as its effective maximum. More complex or negative
   * ranges are currently not handled, so results in those cases may be ambiguous.
   * @param mode either RGB, HSB, HSL,
   * or one of the extended modes described above.
   * @param max range for all values.
   * @returns The current color mode.

   * A vector can be thought of in different ways. In one view, a vector is like
   * an arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and
   * direction. This view is helpful for programming motion.
   * 
   * A vector's components determine its magnitude and direction. For example,
   * calling `createVector(3, 4)` creates a new
   * <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object with an x-component of 3 and a
   * y-component of 4. From the origin, this vector's tip is 3 units to the
   * right and 4 units down.
   * 
   * You can also pass N dimensions to the `createVector` function. For example,
   * calling `createVector(1, 2, 3, 4)` creates a vector with four components.
   * This allows for flexibility in representing vectors in higher-dimensional
   * spaces.
   * 
   * Calling `createVector()` with no arguments is deprecated and will emit
   * a friendly warning. Use `createVector(0)`, `createVector(0, 0)`, or
   * `createVector(0, 0, 0)` instead.
   * 
   * <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> objects are often used to program
   * motion because they simplify the math. For example, a moving ball has a
   * position and a velocity. Position describes where the ball is in space. The
   * ball's position vector extends from the origin to the ball's center.
   * Velocity describes the ball's speed and the direction it's moving. If the
   * ball is moving straight up, its velocity vector points straight up. Adding
   * the ball's velocity vector to its position vector moves it, as in
   * `pos.add(vel)`. Vector math relies on methods inside the

   * of `gridDivisions` to 5, and offsets the axes icon by 10 pixels along the

   * The third way to call `debugMode()` has five parameters. The first

   * Spot lights are like flashlights that shine in one direction creating a
   * cone of light. The shape of the cone can be controlled using the angle and
   * concentration parameters. A maximum of 5 spot lights can be active at once.
   * 
   * There are eight ways to call `spotLight()` with parameters to set the
   * light’s color, position, direction. For example,
   * `spotLight(255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)` creates a red `(255, 0, 0)` light
   * at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` that points to the right `(1, 0, 0)`.
   * 
   * The `angle` parameter is optional. It sets the radius of the light cone.
   * For example, `spotLight(255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, PI / 16)` creates a
   * red `(255, 0, 0)` light at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` that points to the right
   * `(1, 0, 0)` with an angle of `PI / 16` radians. By default, `angle` is
   * `PI / 3` radians.
   * 
   * The `concentration` parameter is also optional. It focuses the light
   * towards the center of the light cone. For example,
   * `spotLight(255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, PI / 16, 50)` creates a red
   * `(255, 0, 0)` light at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` that points to the right
   * `(1, 0, 0)` with an angle of `PI / 16` radians at concentration of 50. By
   * default, `concentration` is 100.

  /**
   * Loads a 3D model to create a
   * <a href="#/p5.Geometry">p5.Geometry</a> object.
   * 
   * `loadModel()` can load 3D models from OBJ and STL files. Once the model is
   * loaded, it can be displayed with the
   * <a href="#/p5/model">model()</a> function, as in `model(shape)`.
   * 
   * There are three ways to call `loadModel()` with optional parameters to help
   * process the model.
   * 
   * The first parameter, `path`, is a `String` with the path to the file. Paths
   * to local files should be relative, as in `loadModel('assets/model.obj')`.
   * URLs such as `'https://example.com/model.obj'` may be blocked due to browser
   * security. The `path` parameter can also be defined as a `Request`
   * object for more advanced usage.
   * Note: When loading a `.obj` file that references materials stored in
   * `.mtl` files, p5.js will attempt to load and apply those materials.
   * To ensure that the `.obj` file reads the `.mtl` file correctly include the
   * `.mtl` file alongside it.
   * 
   * The first way to call `loadModel()` has three optional parameters after the
   * file path. The first optional parameter, `successCallback`, is a function
   * to call once the model loads. For example,
   * `loadModel('assets/model.obj', handleModel)` will call the `handleModel()`
   * function once the model loads. The second optional parameter,
   * `failureCallback`, is a function to call if the model fails to load. For
   * example, `loadModel('assets/model.obj', handleModel, handleFailure)` will
   * call the `handleFailure()` function if an error occurs while loading. The
   * third optional parameter, `fileType`, is the model’s file extension as a
   * string. For example,
   * `loadModel('assets/model', handleModel, handleFailure, '.obj')` will try to
   * load the file model as a `.obj` file.
   * 
   * The second way to call `loadModel()` has four optional parameters after the
   * file path. The first optional parameter is a `Boolean` value. If `true` is
   * passed, as in `loadModel('assets/model.obj', true)`, then the model will be
   * resized to ensure it fits the canvas. The next three parameters are
   * `successCallback`, `failureCallback`, and `fileType` as described above.
   * 
   * The third way to call `loadModel()` has one optional parameter after the
   * file path. The optional parameter, `options`, is an `Object` with options,
   * as in `loadModel('assets/model.obj', options)`. The `options` object can
   * have the following properties:
   * 
   * `let options = {
   * // Enables standardized size scaling during loading if set to true.
   * normalize: true,
   * 
   * // Function to call once the model loads.
   * successCallback: handleModel,
   * 
   * // Function to call if an error occurs while loading.

   * // Pass the options object to loadModel().
   * loadModel('assets/model.obj', options);`This function returns a `Promise` and should be used in an `async` setup with

   * WebGL mode.
   * 
   * `perspective()` changes the camera’s perspective by changing its viewing
   * frustum. The frustum is the volume of space that’s visible to the camera.
   * Its shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera is placed where
   * the top of the pyramid should be and views everything between the frustum’s
   * top (near) plane and its bottom (far) plane.
   * 
   * The first parameter, `fovy`, is the camera’s vertical field of view. It’s
   * an angle that describes how tall or narrow a view the camera has. For
   * example, calling `perspective(0.5)` sets the camera’s vertical field of
   * view to 0.5 radians. By default, `fovy` is calculated based on the sketch’s
   * height and the camera’s default z-coordinate, which is 800. The formula for
   * the default `fovy` is `2 * atan(height / 2 / 800)`.
   *

   * that describes the ratio of the top plane’s width to its height. For
   * example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5)` sets the camera’s field of view to
   * 0.5 radians and aspect ratio to 1.5, which would make shapes appear thinner
   * on a square canvas. By default, aspect is set to `width / height`.
   * 
   * The third parameter, `near`, is the distance from the camera to the near
   * plane. For example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100)` sets the camera’s
   * field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, and places the near
   * plane 100 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn less than 100 pixels

   * plane. For example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100, 10000)` sets the
   * camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, places the
   * near plane 100 pixels from the camera, and places the far plane 10,000
   * pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn more than 10,000 pixels from the

/**
 * One of the two render modes in p5.js, used for computationally intensive tasks like 3D rendering and shaders.
 * 
 * `WEBGL` differs from the default <a href="/reference/p5/P2D">`P2D`</a> renderer in the following ways:
 * 
 * - Coordinate System - When drawing in `WEBGL` mode, the origin point (0,0,0) is located at the center of the screen, not the top-left corner. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/coordinates-and-transformations/">the tutorial page about coordinates and transformations</a>.
 * 
 * - 3D Shapes - `WEBGL` mode can be used to draw 3-dimensional shapes like <a href="#/p5/box">box()</a>, <a href="#/p5/sphere">sphere()</a>, <a href="#/p5/cone">cone()</a>, and <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#3D%20Primitives">more</a>. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/custom-geometry/">the tutorial page about custom geometry</a> to make more complex objects.
 * 
 * - Shape Detail - When drawing in `WEBGL` mode, you can specify how smooth curves should be drawn by using a `detail` parameter. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#3d-primitives-shapes">the wiki section about shapes</a> for a more information and an example.
 * 
 * - Textures - A texture is like a skin that wraps onto a shape. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#textures">the wiki section about textures</a> for examples of mapping images onto surfaces with textures.
 * 
 * - Materials and Lighting - `WEBGL` offers different types of lights like <a href="#/p5/ambientLight">ambientLight()</a> to place around a scene. Materials like <a href="#/p5/specularMaterial">specularMaterial()</a> reflect the lighting to convey shape and depth. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/lights-camera-materials/">the tutorial page for styling and appearance</a> to experiment with different combinations.
 * 
 * - Camera - The viewport of a `WEBGL` sketch can be adjusted by changing camera attributes. See <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/lights-camera-materials#camera-and-view">the tutorial page section about cameras</a> for an explanation of camera controls.
 * 
 * - Text - `WEBGL` requires opentype/truetype font files to be preloaded using <a href="#/p5/loadFont">loadFont()</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5#text">the wiki section about text</a> for details, along with a workaround.
 * 
 * - Shaders - Shaders are hardware accelerated programs that can be used for a variety of effects and graphics. See the <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/intro-to-shaders/">introduction to shaders</a> to get started with shaders in p5.js.
 * 
 * - Graphics Acceleration - `WEBGL` mode uses the graphics card instead of the CPU, so it may help boost the performance of your sketch (example: drawing more shapes on the screen at once).
 * 
 * To learn more about WEBGL mode, check out <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/#webgl">all the interactive WEBGL tutorials</a> in the "Tutorials" section of this website, or read the wiki article <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5">"Getting started with WebGL in p5"</a>.

 * <a href="#/p5/background">background()</a>, and

 * using the RGB color model. This is equivalent to calling
 * `colorMode(RGB, 255)`. Pure red is `color(255, 0, 0)` in this model.
 * 
 * Calling `colorMode(RGB, 100)` sets colors to use RGB color values
 * between 0 and 100. Pure red is `color(100, 0, 0)` in this model.
 * 
 * Calling `colorMode(HSB)` or `colorMode(HSL)` changes to HSB or HSL systems instead of RGB.
 * Pure red is `color(0, 100, 100)` in HSB and `color(0, 100, 50)` in HSL.
 * 
 * Some additional color modes that p5.js supports are:
 * 
 * `RGBHDR` - High Dynamic Range RGB defined within the Display P3 color space.
 * Colors are expressed with an extended dynamic range. To render these colors
 * accurately, you must use the HDR canvas.
 * 
 * `HWB`    - Hue, Whiteness, Blackness.
 * Similar to HSB and HSL, this mode uses a hue angle.
 * Instead of saturation and lightness, HWB defines colors based on the percentage
 * of whiteness and blackness. This is the color model used by Chrome's GUI color picker.
 * Pure red in HWB is represented as `color(0, 0, 0)` (i.e., hue 0 with 0% whiteness and 0% blackness).
 * 
 * `     <img src="assets/hwb.png"></img>``LAB`    - Also known as CIE Lab, this color mode defines colors with Lightness, Alpha, and Beta.
 * It is widely used in professional color measurement contexts due to its perceptual uniformity.
 * 
 * `LCH`    - A more intuitive representation of the CIE Lab color space using Lightness, Chroma, and Hue.
 * This mode separates the color's chromatic intensity (chroma) from its lightness,
 * simplifying color selection and manipulation.
 * 
 * `OKLAB`  - A variant of the CIE Lab color space that corrects for non-uniformities inherent in LAB.
 * The adjustment provides a more perceptually accurate and uniform representation,
 * which is particularly beneficial for smooth color transitions.
 * 
 * `OKLCH`  - An easier-to-use representation of OKLAB, expressing colors in terms of Lightness, Chroma, and Hue.
 * This mode retains the perceptual benefits of OKLAB while offering a more intuitive format for color manipulation.
 * 
 * <a href="#/p5.Color">p5.Color</a> objects remember the mode that they were
 * created in. Changing modes doesn't affect their appearance.
 * 
 * `Single-value (Grayscale) Colors`:
 * When a color is specified with only one parameter (e.g., `color(g)`), p5.js will interpret it
 * as a grayscale color. However, how that single parameter translates into a grayscale value
 * depends on the color mode:
 * 
 * - `RGB, HSB, and HSL`: In RGB, the single value is interpreted using the “blue” maximum
 * (i.e., the single parameter is mapped to the blue channel's max).
 * In HSB and HSL, the single value is mapped to Brightness and Lightness max respectively with hue=0 .
 * and saturation=0.
 * 
 * - `LAB, LCH, OKLAB, and OKLCH`: The single value is taken to be the `lightness (L)` component,
 * with the specified max range for that channel.
 * 
 * - `HWB`: Grayscale relies on both the `whiteness (W)` and `blackness (B)` channels. Since
 * a single value cannot directly account for two distinct channels, the library uses an
 * average of their max values to interpret the single grayscale parameter. For instance,
 * if W has a max of 50 and B has a max of 100, then the single grayscale parameter
 * is mapped using (50 + 100) / 2 = 75 as its effective maximum. More complex or negative
 * ranges are currently not handled, so results in those cases may be ambiguous.
 * @param mode either RGB, HSB, HSL,
 * or one of the extended modes described above.
 * @param max range for all values.
 * @returns The current color mode.

/**
 * Translates the coordinate system.
 * 
 * By default, the origin `(0, 0)` is at the sketch's top-left corner in 2D
 * mode and center in WebGL mode. The `translate()` function shifts the origin
 * to a different position. Everything drawn after `translate()` is called
 * will appear to be shifted. There are two ways to call `translate()` with
 * parameters that set the origin's position.
 * 
 * The first way to call `translate()` uses numbers to set the amount of
 * translation. The first two parameters, `x` and `y`, set the amount to
 * translate along the positive x- and y-axes. For example, calling
 * `translate(20, 30)` translates the origin 20 pixels along the x-axis and 30
 * pixels along the y-axis. The third parameter, `z`, is optional. It sets the
 * amount to translate along the positive z-axis. For example, calling
 * `translate(20, 30, 40)` translates the origin 20 pixels along the x-axis,
 * 30 pixels along the y-axis, and 40 pixels along the z-axis.
 * 
 * The second way to call `translate()` uses a
 * <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object to set the amount of
 * translation. For example, calling `translate(myVector)` uses the x-, y-,
 * and z-components of `myVector` to set the amount to translate along the x-,
 * y-, and z-axes. Doing so is the same as calling
 * `translate(myVector.x, myVector.y, myVector.z)`.
 * 
 * By default, transformations accumulate. For example, calling
 * `translate(10, 0)` twice has the same effect as calling
 * `translate(20, 0)` once. The <a href="#/p5/push">push()</a> and
 * <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a> functions can be used to isolate
 * transformations within distinct drawing groups.
 * 
 * Note: Transformations are reset at the beginning of the draw loop. Calling
 * `translate(10, 0)` inside the <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> function won't
 * cause shapes to move continuously.
 * @param x amount to translate along the positive x-axis.
 * @param y amount to translate along the positive y-axis.
 * @param z amount to translate along the positive z-axis.

 * all drawing that follows. The `push()` and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a>
 * functions can limit the effect of styles and transformations to a specific

 * pop();
 * 
 * // Draw a bug.
 * let x = random(0, 100);
 * let y = random(0, 100);
 * text('🦟', x, y);`In the code snippet above, the bug's position isn't affected by
 * `translate(mouseX, mouseY)` because that transformation is contained
 * between `push()` and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a>. The bug moves around
 * the entire canvas as expected.
 * 
 * Note: `push()` and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a> are always called as a
 * pair. Both functions are required to begin and end a drawing group.
 * 
 * `push()` and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a> can also be nested to create

 * is passed, as in `debugMode(AXES)`, then the axes icon will be displayed
 * and the grid will be hidden.
 * 
 * The second way to call `debugMode()` has six parameters. The first
 * parameter, `mode`, selects either `GRID` or `AXES` to be displayed. The
 * next five parameters, `gridSize`, `gridDivisions`, `xOff`, `yOff`, and
 * `zOff` are optional. They’re numbers that set the appearance of the grid
 * (`gridSize` and `gridDivisions`) and the placement of the axes icon

 * of `gridDivisions` to 5, and offsets the axes icon by 10 pixels along the
 * x-, y-, and z-axes.
 * 
 * The third way to call `debugMode()` has five parameters. The first
 * parameter, `mode`, selects either `GRID` or `AXES` to be displayed. The
 * next four parameters, `axesSize`, `xOff`, `yOff`, and `zOff` are optional.

 * to local files should be relative, as in `loadModel('assets/model.obj')`.
 * URLs such as `'https://example.com/model.obj'` may be blocked due to browser

 * `.mtl` files, p5.js will attempt to load and apply those materials.
 * To ensure that the `.obj` file reads the `.mtl` file correctly include the
 * `.mtl` file alongside it.
 * 
 * The first way to call `loadModel()` has three optional parameters after the

 * call the `handleFailure()` function if an error occurs while loading. The
 * third optional parameter, `fileType`, is the model’s file extension as a
 * string. For example,
 * `loadModel('assets/model', handleModel, handleFailure, '.obj')` will try to
 * load the file model as a `.obj` file.
 * 
 * The second way to call `loadModel()` has four optional parameters after the
 * file path. The first optional parameter is a `Boolean` value. If `true` is
 * passed, as in `loadModel('assets/model.obj', true)`, then the model will be
 * resized to ensure it fits the canvas. The next three parameters are
 * `successCallback`, `failureCallback`, and `fileType` as described above.
 *

 * as in `loadModel('assets/model.obj', options)`. The `options` object can
 * have the following properties:
 * 
 * `let options = {
 * // Enables standardized size scaling during loading if set to true.

 * <a href="#/p5.Shader">p5.Shader</a> object.
 * 
 * Shaders are programs that run on the graphics processing unit (GPU). They
 * can process many pixels at the same time, making them fast for many
 * graphics tasks. They’re written in a language called
 * <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/GLSL_Shaders" target="_blank">GLSL</a>
 * and run along with the rest of the code in a sketch.
 * 
 * Once the <a href="#/p5.Shader">p5.Shader</a> object is created, it can be
 * used with the <a href="#/p5/shader">shader()</a> function, as in
 * `shader(myShader)`. A shader program consists of two files, a vertex shader
 * and a fragment shader. The vertex shader affects where 3D geometry is drawn
 * on the screen and the fragment shader affects color.
 * 
 * `loadShader()` loads the vertex and fragment shaders from their `.vert` and
 * `.frag` files. For example, calling
 * `loadShader('assets/shader.vert', 'assets/shader.frag')` loads both
 * required shaders and returns a <a href="#/p5.Shader">p5.Shader</a> object.
 * 
 * The third parameter, `successCallback`, is optional. If a function is
 * passed, it will be called once the shader has loaded. The callback function
 * can use the new <a href="#/p5.Shader">p5.Shader</a> object as its
 * parameter. The return value of the `successCallback()` function will be used
 * as the final return value of `loadShader()`.
 * 
 * The fourth parameter, `failureCallback`, is also optional. If a function is
 * passed, it will be called if the shader fails to load. The callback
 * function can use the event error as its parameter. The return value of the `
 * failureCallback()` function will be used as the final return value of `loadShader()`.
 * 
 * This function returns a `Promise` and should be used in an `async` setup with
 * `await`. See the examples for the usage syntax.
 * 
 * Note: Shaders can only be used in WebGL mode.
 * @param vertFilename path of the vertex shader to be loaded.
 * @param fragFilename path of the fragment shader to be loaded.

 * `Error` event object.

 * Once the <a href="#/p5.Shader">p5.Shader</a> object is created, it can be
 * used with the <a href="#/p5/shader">shader()</a> function, as in
 * `shader(myShader)`. A shader program consists of two parts, a vertex shader
 * and a fragment shader. The vertex shader affects where 3D geometry is drawn
 * on the screen and the fragment shader affects color.
 * 
 * The first parameter, `vertSrc`, sets the vertex shader. It’s a string that
 * contains the vertex shader program written in GLSL.
 * 
 * The second parameter, `fragSrc`, sets the fragment shader. It’s a string
 * that contains the fragment shader program written in GLSL.
 * 
 * A shader can optionally describe hooks, which are functions in GLSL that
 * users may choose to provide to customize the behavior of the shader using the
 * <a href="#/p5.Shader/modify">`modify()`</a> method of `p5.Shader`. These are added by
 * describing the hooks in a third parameter, `options`, and referencing the hooks in
 * your `vertSrc` or `fragSrc`. Hooks for the vertex or fragment shader are described under
 * the `vertex` and `fragment` keys of `options`. Each one is an object. where each key is
 * the type and name of a hook function, and each value is a string with the
 * parameter list and default implementation of the hook. For example, to let users
 * optionally run code at the start of the vertex shader, the options object could
 * include:
 * 
 * `{
 * vertex: {
 * 'void beforeVertex': '() {}'
 * }
 * }`Then, in your vertex shader source, you can run a hook by calling a function
 * with the same name prefixed by `HOOK_`. If you want to check if the default
 * hook has been replaced, maybe to avoid extra overhead, you can check if the
 * same name prefixed by `AUGMENTED_HOOK_` has been defined:
 * 
 * `void main() {
 * // In most cases, just calling the hook is fine:
 * HOOK_beforeVertex();
 * 
 * // Alternatively, for more efficiency:
 * #ifdef AUGMENTED_HOOK_beforeVertex
 * HOOK_beforeVertex();
 * #endif
 * 
 * // Add the rest of your shader code here!

 * 
 * Each call to <a href="#/p5/vertex">vertex()</a> must include 5 arguments,
 * as in `vertex(x, y, z, u, v)`, to map the vertex at coordinates `(x, y, z)`
 * to the pixel at coordinates `(u, v)` within an image. For example, the

 * 
 * `// Apply the image as a texture.
 * texture(img);
 * 
 * // Draw the rectangle.
 * rect(0, 0, 30, 50);`If the image in the code snippet above has dimensions of 300 x 500 pixels,
